# YOLO5-cucumber
interesting homework, by using yolo5 for cucumber quality detection
The result to judge whether a cucumber is good or not is the scour and dune of the cucumber's surface, which yolo5 is deployed for these detections.
For example:
![cucumber_0_5007 (30)](https://github.com/DengYaosheng/YOLO5-cucumber/assets/41530023/b71f1769-5e9a-4393-836b-1956322bfd3c)
